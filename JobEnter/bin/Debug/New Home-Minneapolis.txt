Note: While we show a proposed dwelling, related improvements and grading & drainage details, we are not as familiar with the plan or overall concept for the project as our client, their builder, or their architect is.  Before relying on the survey for construc-tion and design or submitting the provided information to the city, the client is responsible to verify we are depicting their pro-posed dwelling and improvements correctly.
Note: Gaining governmental approvals for your proposed dwelling and improvements is independent of the services we provide.  While we provide the appropriate documents to submit to such governmental agencies, we do not guarantee that your project will be approved at the city or county level.
