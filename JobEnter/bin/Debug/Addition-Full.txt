Show area enclosed by building perimeter at ground level.
Show the door threshold (entrance) elevation of the building on the site.
Show the floor elevation of the garage, nearest the door, on the site.
Tabulate areas of existing hardcover. Note: Impervious surface requirements vary city to city. Be sure to have this tabulation reviewed and approved by the appropriate governmental agency before using this information for any site design or construction.
Show the peak or eave height of the existing building on site, as directed by the client.

-Utilities
Show visible improvements related to public utilities such as, but not limited to, curbs, roadways, sidewalks.
Show visible appurtenances to utilities in adjacent streets and alleys such as, manholes, power poles, catch basins, overhead utility lines or cable/telephone pedestals.

-Natural Features
Show edge of wooded areas and isolated, significant trees.
Show significant or isolated bushes and or shrubs. 
Show topography over the entire lot and up to the edge of the adjacent roadway at a contour interval of 1 or 2 feet, whichever is more appropriate. In addition to contours, show critical spot elevations across the property, as needed, to depict vertical relief.

Show approximate top of steep slope.
Show Bluff Line, per our interpretation of the city definition. Note: While we show the bluff line per our interpretation of the city’s code, be sure to gain verification and approval from the city that they are correct before proceeding with any site design or construction.

-Addition
Show footprint of the proposed dwelling and related improvements, per your plans.
Show proposed elevations for the first floor, low floor, top of foundation, and garage floor.
Show proposed grading & drainage details by depicting proposed contours, spot elevations, and drainage arrows, as necessary, to show the control of storm water runoff.
Tabulate areas of proposed hardcover. Note: Impervious surface requirements vary city to city. Be sure to have this tabulation reviewed and approved by the appropriate governmental agency before using this information for any site design or construction.
Note: While we show a proposed dwelling, related improvements and grading & drainage details, we are not as familiar with the plan or overall concept for the project as our client, their builder, or their architect is. Before relying on the survey for construction and design or submitting the provided information to the city, the client is responsible to verify we are depicting their pro-posed dwelling and improvements correctly.
Note: Gaining governmental approvals for your proposed dwelling and improvements is independent of the services we provide. While we provide the appropriate documents to submit to such governmental agencies, we do not guarantee that your project will be approved at the city or county level.
