-Building and Improvements
Show significant and visible improvements deemed necessary by the surveyor on site, unless otherwise specified by the client beforehand.
Show any apparent and significant encroachments across boundary lines observed in the process of conducting the fieldwork.
Show front and nearest side (front to back) of the homes on the adjacent lots that front the same street as the subject property.
Show minimum building setback lines.  Note: While we show minimum building setbacks lines per our interpretation of the city’s code, be sure to gain verification and approval from the city that they are correct before proceeding with any site design or construction.
Show exterior dimensions of the building footprint along with building corner dimensions to the lot line, as measured perpendicular to the lot line.
Show the door threshold (entrance) elevation of the building on the site.
Show the floor elevation of the garage, nearest the door, on the site.
Tabulate areas of existing hardcover.  Note: Impervious surface requirements vary city to city. Be sure to have this tabulation reviewed and approved by the appropriate governmental agency before using this information for any site design or construction.
Show the peak or eave height of the existing building on site, as directed by the client.

-Environmental
Show approximate edge of wooded areas and isolated large trees, as specified by the client. Species not determined by surveyor.
Show location of trees larger than 6”+/- inches in diameter, unless otherwise specified by client.  Species not determined by surveyor.
Show significant or isolated bushes and or shrubs.
Show topography over the entire lot and up to the edge of the adjacent roadway at a contour interval of 1 or 2 feet, whichever is more appropriate.  In addition to contours, show critical spot elevations across the property, as needed, to depict vertical relief.
Establish a project benchmark in relation to the topography shown.
Show approximate shoreline of the body of water at the time of the survey.
Show the ordinary high water (OHW) contour line as determined by the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources.
Show delineated wetland by locating wetland flags set by a certified wetland delineator.
Show approximate edge of lowland per the plat and/or field observations.
Show approximate top of steep slope.
Show Bluff Line, per our interpretation of the city definition.  Note: While we show the bluff line per our interpretation of the city’s code, be sure to gain verification and approval from the city that they are correct before proceeding with any site design or construction.

-Utilities
Show visible improvements related to public utilities such as, but not limited to, curbs, roadways, sidewalks.
Show public utilities from plans or markings, combined with visible evidence of such utilities to develop a view of underground utility lines.  Note: The exact location of underground features cannot be accurately, completely, and reliably depicted without actual excavation of those utilities.

-Winter/Hardcover Note
Client is responsible for clearing snow and ice off of all impervious surfaces prior to survey.  Snow and ice must be removed entirely so that the edge of the surface is clearly identifiable.  If the surveyor determines the snow and ice have not been properly removed from all surfaces at the time of the survey, impervious surface calculations will be shown as an approximate value (+/-).  Approximate values may or may not be sufficient for design or city approval.
