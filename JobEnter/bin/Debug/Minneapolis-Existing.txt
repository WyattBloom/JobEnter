Client is responsible for clearing snow and ice off of all impervious surfaces prior to survey.  Snow and ice must be removed entirely so that the edge of the surface is clearly identifiable.  If the surveyor determines the snow and ice have not been properly removed from all surfaces at the time of the survey, impervious surface calculations will be shown as an approximate value (+/-).  Approximate values may or may not be sufficient for design or city approval.
Show significant or isolated bushes and or shrubs.
Show topography over the entire lot and up to the edge of the adjacent roadway at a contour interval of 1 or 2 feet, whichever is more appropriate.  In addition to contours, show critical spot elevations across the property, as needed, to depict vertical relief.
